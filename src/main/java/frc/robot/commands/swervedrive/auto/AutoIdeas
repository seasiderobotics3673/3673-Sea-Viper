move forward outside of starting line 88in to leave area
THEN if possible rotate towards coral for drivers so they can score after auto (unsure how much rotate is needed)

3. SCORE CORAL IN REEF

THEN spit piece into trough with opposite speeds to rotate piece
(if wanting L2, L3, or L4 do steps below)
move elevator to Level desired and use high or low limit switches to keep elevator within happy range to deposit coral in spesific spot
